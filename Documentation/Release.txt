OpenTK 0.3.12.4 WIP Release notes

IMPORTANT: This release is intended for testing and experimentation only. Use at your own risk!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Highlights:

 * Feature: Mouse input support.
 * Feature: Two new tutorials (T02: Vertex Arrays) and (T04: Vertex Lighting) which showcase the relevant OpenGL features.
 * Feature: A new Test (S03: Extensions) which uses reflection to obtain a list of extensions supported by your hardware. NOT SUPPORTED UNDER MONO 1.2.5 (Mono Windows.Forms implementation issue).
 * Feature: GameWindow.Title property to retrieve or set the title of the GameWindow.
 * Feature: GameWindow.Run() can now set a target update and render frequency.
 * Feature: Improved GameWindow events. No need to call base functions on inheriting classes (i.e. base.OnRenderFrame inside the OnRenderFrame override).
 * Feature: Optimized GL.LoadAll().
 * Feature: Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 structs, with associated math functions.

 * Bug fix: Added a few missing Keys in Keyboard.
 * Bug fix: Resize event was raised twice during GameWindow startup.

 * Known issue: ExampleLauncher shuts down when closing any GameWindow under Linux.
 * Known issue: 32-bit modes exhibit flashing under Mesa3d 6.5.x/Ubuntu 7.04. Is a Mesa3d problem, update to Mesa3d 7.0.x or request a 24-bit depth.
 * Known issue: GameWindow may become unstable after extended mouse movements on Windows. Probably due to an (unknown) OpenTK MouseDevice driver bug.
 * Known issue: GameWindow only reports one Mouse- and one KeyboardDevice. Methods for multiple devices will be provided in the future.
