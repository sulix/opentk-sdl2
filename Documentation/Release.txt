GameWindow APIs and fixes several occurences of bitrot in the codebase.

API changes

The MouseDevice.ButtonDown and .ButtonUp events have changed signatures to better 
conform to the BCL conventions. This is a breaking change. Please change your relevant 
event handler signatures from:

void ButtonHandler(MouseDevice sender, MouseButton button)
{
}

to:

void ButtonHandler(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
}

The MouseDevice.XDelta, .YDelta and .WheelDelta properties have been deprecated and 
will be removed at a later version. Please use the Move and WheelChanged events 
instead, or track mouse deltas manually.

GameWindow.ExitAsync() is no longer available. Please use GameWindow.Exit(),
instead.
