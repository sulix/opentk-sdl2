OpenTK 0.3.12.4 WIP Release notes

IMPORTANT: This release is intended for testing and experimentation only. Use at your own risk!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Highlights:

 * Feature: Mouse input support.
 * Feature: Two new tutorials (T02: Vertex Arrays) and (T04: Vertex Lighting) showcase the relevant OpenGL features.
 * Feature: A new Test (S03: Extensions) uses reflection to obtain a list of extensions supported by your hardware. See known issues!
 * Feature: GameWindow.Title property to retrieve or set the title of the GameWindow.
 * Feature: GameWindow.Run() can now set a target update and render frequency.
 * Feature: Improved GameWindow events. No need to call base functions on inheriting classes (i.e. base.OnRenderFrame inside the OnRenderFrame override).
 * Feature: Optimized GL.LoadAll().
 * Feature: Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 structs, with associated math functions. NOT READY FOR USE YET, INTERFACE WILL CHANGE.

 * Bug fix: Missing Key mapping in Windows and Linux in Keyboard drivers.
 * Bug fix: Resize event was raised twice during GameWindow startup.

 * Known issue (Windows): GameWindow may become unstable after extended mouse movements on Windows. Probably due to an (unknown) OpenTK MouseDevice driver bug.
 * Known issue (Linux): ExampleLauncher abruptly shuts down when closing a GameWindow through the 'X' (close) button.
 * Known issue (Linux): OpenTK programs may exhibit instability under Mesa3d 6.5.x and/or Mono 1.2.4. Update to Mesa3d 7.0.x and Mono 1.2.5 to resolve this.
 * Known issue (Linux): DisplayModes with 32-bit bitdepths exhibit flashing under Mesa3d 6.5.x. Is a Mesa3d problem, update to Mesa3d 7.0.x or request a 24-bit depth.
 * Known issue (Linux): Example T10: "GLSL Cube" may report a glibc error when shutting down.Cube.
 * Known issue (Linux): Example S03: "Extensions" crashes under Mono 1.2.x
 * Known issue (Linux): Example T04: "Vertex Lighting" may exhibit incorrect lighting under some circumstances (Mesa3d 7.0.x)
