Generic Todos:
+ Correctly implement disposable pattern in all relevant classes (WIP as of 0.3.8).
+ Investigate startup lag.


Bind:
* Get ready for OpenGL 3.0 (Long Peaks).
* Fix problems reported on the Tao Framework forums.


OpenTK.OpenGL todos:
* Change the GCHandle method of pinning to 'fixed'. The behaviour is different: fixed guarantees pinning of the whole object.
* Different classes for each extension category (ARB.Foo, instead of FooARB).
+ Inline XML documentation.
+ Add complete Wgl, Glx, Agl and Glu bindings.
+ Get rid of the "object" overloads in favour of generics.


OpenTK.Platform:
* GLContext class:
	+ Add more constructors.
	+ Add native support for the MacOS X platform (now goes through X).
* GLControl class:
	+ Improve the interface. Add more constructors.
* GameWindow class:
	+ Add input support.


OpenTK.Input todos:
* Make Key class non-static. Static means all GameWindows share the same input!
* Complete the Key class.
* Implement mouse input.
+ Implement other input devices.


OpenTK.Timing todos:
+ Start implementing the Timer module.


Examples:
+ Add comments were needed.
+ Add more Tutorials and WinForms examples.


OpenTK.Math todos:
+ Start implementing the Math module.


OpenTK.OpenAL todos:
+ Start researching the OpenAL module.
+ Take a look at the OpenALDotNet wrapper.
