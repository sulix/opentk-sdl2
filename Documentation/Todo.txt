[General]
+ Split OpenTK.Utilities from the core OpenTK.
+ Change all public APIs to conform to the class library interface guidelines.
+ Revisit all classes and make sure IDisposable is correctly implemented.

[OpenTK.Graphics.GL]
+ Improve performance for functions that return StringBuilders.

[OpenTK.Graphics.GraphicsContext]
+ FSAA support (very simple, now that GL3 support has been added.)

[OpenTK.GLControl]
+ Improve the designer interface.

[OpenTK.Input]
+ Implement joystick support on Mac OS X.
+ Implement GameWindow-independent input drivers.
+ Implement support for multiple mice and keyboards.

[Examples]
+ Add GL3 examples.
+ Add more comprehensive Graphics and Audio tutorials.

[OpenTK.Compute]
+ Begin the implementation.
