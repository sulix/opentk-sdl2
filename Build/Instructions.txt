Installation

OpenTK does not require installation. Simply decompress the archive to a folder of your choice.


Usage

To use OpenTK, you need to reference "OpenTK.dll". Refer to http://www.opentk.com/doc for specific instructions.

Regardless of your development environment and operating system, ensure that you copy "OpenTK.dll.config" to the output directory. Without OpenTK.dll.config, your application will not function on Linux or MacOS.


Build instructions

You can build OpenTK using Visual Studio 2005+, SharpDevelop 2.0+, MonoDevelop 2.0+, msbuild or nant. Instructions:

1a. Open the Build/ folder.

1b. If you are using a fresh SVN checkout, double click "Build.exe", type "vs" and press enter twice to create OpenTK.sln. This step is not necessary if you are using a released version of OpenTK.

2a. If you are using Visual Studio, SharpDevelop or MonoDevelop, double-click OpenTK.sln, select a build configuration (debug/release) and build the project.

2b. If you wish to build from the commandline:

[Windows]
Make sure msbuild is in your path and type:

cd Build
Build.exe vs
msbuild

[Linux / MacOS]
Make sure nant (http://nant.sourceforge.net) is in your path and type:

cd Build/
mono Build.exe nant release

4. The resulting binaries are placed into the Binaries/Release or Binaries/Debug folder.
