How to build OpenTK:

1) Install nant from (http://nant.sourceforge.net/)
2) Navigate to the Build folder and execute Build.exe:
	2a) Under Linux/Mac OS X, type 'mono Build.exe mono' or 'mono Build.exe mono debug' for the release/debug versions of the library.
	2b) Under Windows type 'build net' (or 'build net debug').
3) The binaries (library, examples) are placed in the Binaries/Release folder.


There are other parameters you can pass to Build.exe. A brief list:

net - build using the .Net framework.
mono - build using Mono.
debug - build the debug version (e.g. 'build net debug').

clean - delete intermediate object files and projects (reclaim some space, the binaries are not touched).
distclean - delete intermediate and final object files (reclaim all space used during compilation).
svnclean - delete '.svn' folders. Useful if you checked out from svn, useless if you downloaded a file release.

vs2005 - create project files for Visual Studio 2005.
monodev - create project files for MonoDevelop.
sharpdev - as above, for SharpDevelop.
