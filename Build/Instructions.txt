Installation

OpenTK does not require installation. Simply decompress the archive to a folder of your choice.


Usage

To use OpenTK, you need to reference OpenTK.dll from your project. The way you do this changes from IDE to IDE - refer to http://www.opentk.com/doc for specific instructions.

In any case, make sure the OpenTK.dll.config file is copied to the output directory along OpenTK.dll. This file is *required* for OpenTK to work on Linux and Mac OS X.


Build instructions

If you have Visual Studio 2005/2008 or MonoDevelop 2 (post-beta1), simply open OpenTK.sln in the Build/ folder.

If you wish build from the commandline, install nant (http://nant.sourceforge.net) and execute Build.exe in the Build/ folder.

The resulting binaries are placed in the Binaries/Release or Binaries/Debug folder.
