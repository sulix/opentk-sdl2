This is a source distribution. There are two ways to build a release:

1) Install nant from (http://nant.sourceforge.net/) and execute Build-Mono.bat or Build-Net.bat (Windows) or build.sh (Unix).

2) Execute VS2005.bat or SharpDevelop2.bat (Windows) or MonoDevelop.sh (Unix) to create project files that can be opened and built with the corresponding IDE.
