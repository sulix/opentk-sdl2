How to build OpenTK:

1) Install nant from (http://nant.sourceforge.net/)
2) Navigate to the Build folder and execute Build.exe (type 'mono Build.exe' under Linux/Mac OS X).
	2a) To build the .Net version, type 'Build.exe net' (or 'mono Build.exe net').
	2b) To build the Mono version, type 'Build.exe mono' (or 'mono Build.exe mono').
3) The binaries (library, examples) are placed in the Binaries/Release folder.


There are other parameters you can pass to Build.exe. A brief list:

net - build using the .Net framework.
mono - build using Mono.

clean - delete intermediate object files (reclaim some space, the binaries are not touched).
distclean - delete intermediate and final object files (reclaim all space used during compilation).
svnclean - delete '.svn' folders. Useful if you checked out from svn, useless if you downloaded a file release.

vs2005 - create project files for Visual Studio 2005.
monodev - create project files for MonoDevelop.
sharpdev - as above, for SharpDevelop.
