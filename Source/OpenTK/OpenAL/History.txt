Version History:
 
Alpha v0.1 - 0.8

- Alut: The following functions are not bound/imported. Issue of undoing C malloc to prevent memory leaks.
        "alutLoadMemoryFromFile, alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage, alutLoadMemoryHelloWorld, alutLoadMemoryWaveform"
        Please use Alut.CreateBuffer* functions instead, which have similar functionality and return a Buffer Handle instead.
        Disabled Alut.Sleep, rather use Thread.Sleep
- Alc: All functions imported, Bool and Double functions disabled.
- AL: Functions not imported:
      alListeneri, alListener3i, alListeneriv
      alGetListeneri, alGetListener3i, alGetListeneriv
      alGetBooleanv, alGetIntegerv, alGetFloatv, alGetDoublev 
      imported, but currently disabled: alGetBoolean, alGetDouble
      alBufferf, alBufferfv, alBufferi, alBuffer3i, alBufferiv
      imported, but currently disabled: alBuffer3f
      alGetBufferf, alGetBuffer3f, alGetBufferfv, alGetBuffer3i, alGetBufferiv
      DopplerVelocity, ChannelMask are deprecated and marked.
      The Token AL_DATA is hidden now, as it returns a pointer to unmanaged memory
         where the buffer was located previously to calling AL.BufferData(). (It is usually freed after buffering)
Efx: Functions not imported:
     alEffectiv, alGetEffectiv
     alFilteriv, alFilterfv, alGetFilteriv, alGetFilterfv
     alAuxiliaryEffectSlotiv, alAuxiliaryEffectSlotfv, alGetAuxiliaryEffectSlotiv, alGetAuxiliaryEffectSlotfv
            
- Added Function AL.GetErrorString()
- Added overloads for requesting/deleting a single buffer/source at a time.
- Refactored -i -fv -3f functions to be overloads e.g AL.GetSource, AL.GetListener
- X-Ram Extension untested, as it requires special hardware. !verify parameters of GetBufferMode()!
- functions with ushort, uint, ulong marked as not CLS compliant.

Alpha v0.9
-added docu
-added alEffectfv and alGetEffectfv
-ported samples from SDK

Alpha v0.95
-full cleanup of AL class documentation
-added *.Bind* helpers.


Todo for beta:
- Identify: AL_FILTER_FIRST_PARAMETER, AL_FILTER_LAST_PARAMETER
            AL_EFFECT_FIRST_PARAMETER, AL_EFFECT_LAST_PARAMETER
- replace EaxEfx reverbs with Efx reverbs.

Todo for final:
- Enums themselves require summaries (do after some more serious tests)
